= `TODO` name | short description

You could use this repo (and its' ancestors) as a template to generate a new repo, eg `https://github.com/USER/REPO`

However the commit history will be squashed into the new commit.

To retain the original history, you could execute in the empty working dir:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mirrors-git/TEMPLET-05-Added-GNUmakefile.asciidoc.git .
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
git push -f -u origin main
```

\... and continue with your usual workflow.
